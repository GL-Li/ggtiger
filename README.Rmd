# Draw TIGER census boundaries on ggmap

This package draws and fills in TIGER census boundaries on ggmap with a single function geom_bounday(). As an extension to ggplot2, geom_boundary() works similarly to native ggplot2 geom_xxxx() functions.


## Installation and setup

### Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("GL-Li/ggtiger")
```

### Setup
This package dowloads TIGER shape files into R with package `tigris`. The data is further processed and can be saved as `.csv` files in your own computer. You need to create a directory to store the processed data. Let's call the folder `my_tiger_data` and assume the full path to this folder is `xxxxx/my_tiger_data`. Run the function below to set the path for the package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
set_path_to_tiger("xxxxx/my_tiger_data")
```

## Examples
By default, `geom_boundary()` draws all boundaries of a geography in the view of a ggmap (for the lower 48 states). We can also choose to draw only those boundaries in a state, or in selected counties in a state within the map.

### Draw boundaries
Boundaries of state, county, county subdivision, tract, and block group:
```{r fig.width=12}
library(ggtiger)
ri <- get_map("scituate, RI, united states", zoom = 10, color = "bw")
ggmap(ri) +
    # all tract boundaries in two counties in Rhode Islan
    geom_boundary("tract", state = "RI", county = c("providence", "washington"),
                  fill = NA, color = "orange", size = 0.2) +
    # all county boundaries in Rhode Island
    geom_boundary("county", state = "RI", fill = NA, 
                  color = "green", size = 0.3) +
    # all state boundaries in the view
    geom_boundary("state", fill = NA, linetype = "dotted", 
                  color = "red", size = 0.5)

```

 Boundaries of zip code (zip code tabulation area, based on zip code):
```{r}
ggmap(ri) +
    geom_boundary("zip code", fill = "green", alpha = 0.3, 
                  color = "red", size = 0.1)

```

### Fill in boudaries
We can fill in boudaies using argument `data_fill` in `geom_boundary()`. The argument takes a data frame that has `GEOID` as the first column and fill-in values as the second column. If the data frame is extracted using census packages such as `tidycensus` and `totalcensus`, it already has the `GEOID` column.

```{r fig.width=12}
library(tidycensus)
library(dplyr)
census_api_key("use your own census api key")
# get the median home value in Providence county, RI by tract
home_value <- get_acs("tract", "B25077_001", state = "RI", county = "Providence") %>%
    select(c("GEOID", "estimate"))
ggmap(ri) +
    geom_boundary("tract", data_fill = home_value, 
                  color = "blue", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_boundary("state", fill = NA, color = "red") +
    scale_fill_gradient(na.value = NA, low = "cyan", high = "orange") +
    labs(fill = "home_value")
```

### Combine with point plot
Let's look at the black community near South Bend, Indiana. We present the population at each census block as a point, sized with total population and colored with percentage of black population. On top of that, we draw the boundaries of census tract.

```{r fig.width=12}
library(totalcensus)
sb_black <- read_decennial(
    year = 2010,
    states = "IN",
    table_contents = "black_popul = P0030003",
    areas = "St. Joseph County, IN",
    summary_level = "block"
) %>% 
    .[population != 0] %>%
    # percentage of black population in each block
    .[, black_pct := round(100 * black_popul / population, 2)] %>%
    .[order(black_pct)]

sb <- get_map("south bend, IN", zoom = 13, color = "bw")
p <- ggmap(sb) +
    geom_point(data = sb_black, alpha = 0.8,
               aes(lon, lat, size = population, color = black_pct)) +
    geom_boundary("tract", fill = NA, color = "orange", size = 0.5) +
    scale_size_area(max_size = 15, breaks = c(10, 100, 200, 500, 4000)) +
    scale_color_continuous(low = "green", high = "red") 
p
```

```{r}
# to zoom in
p +  coord_map(xlim = c(-86.26, -86.21), ylim = c(41.67, 41.7))
```
