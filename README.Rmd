# Draw TIGER census boundaries on ggmap

This package draws TIGER census boundaries on ggmap with a single function `geom_bounday()`. As an extension to `ggplot2`, `geom_boundary()` works similarly to native ggplot2 `geom_xxxx()` functions.

It currently draws boundaries of states, counties, county subdivisions, tracts, block groups, zip code tabulation areas, and congressional districts. More geographies are being added.


## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("GL-Li/ggtiger")
```

This package dowloads TIGER shape files into R with package `tigris`. The data is further processed for plotting. If you want to speed up the plotting, save the processed data to your computer. Check with function `set_path_to_tiger()`. 


## Examples
By default, `geom_boundary()` draws all boundaries of a geography in the view of a ggmap. We can also choose to draw only those boundaries in selected states, or in selected counties in a state within the map.

### New example: congressional district gerrymandering
When Republicans or Demecrats are in charge, they tend to draw congressional disctricts boundaries to their favor. This can go very ugly, creating crazy boundaries by a practice called [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering). 

We can visualize the gerrymandering easily with `ggtiger`. The figure below shows a few congressional districts near Philadelpia in Pennsylvania for 115th Congress, including the (in)famous [7th congressional district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania%27s_7th_congressional_district).

```{r}
library(ggtiger)
philly <- get_map("pottstown, PA,  usa", zoom = 9, color = "bw")
ggmap(philly) +
    geom_boundary("congressional district", state = "PA",
                  mapping = aes(fill = ..GEOID..),
                  alpha = 0.7, color = "red", size = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr")
```

### Draw boundaries
Boundaries of state, county, county subdivision, tract, and block group:
```{r}
library(ggtiger)
ri <- get_map("scituate, RI, united states", zoom = 10, color = "bw")
ggmap(ri) +
    # all tract boundaries in two counties in Rhode Island
    geom_boundary("tract", state = "RI", county = c("providence", "washington"),
                  fill = NA, color = "orange", size = 0.2) +
    # all county boundaries in the map
    geom_boundary("county", fill = NA, 
                  color = "green", size = 0.3) +
    # all state boundaries in the map
    geom_boundary("state", fill = NA, linetype = "dotted", 
                  color = "red", size = 0.5)

```

 Boundaries of ZCTA (zip code tabulation area, based on zip code): be aware that ZCTAs sometimes cross county boundaries and even state boundaries.
```{r}
ggmap(ri) +
    # all ZCTAs in or partially in two counties in Rhode Island
    geom_boundary("zip code", state = "RI", 
                  county = c("providence", "washington"),
                  fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1, color = "red", size = 0.3) +
    # all county boundaries in RI. 
    geom_boundary("county", state = "RI", fill = NA, color = "green", 
                  size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted")

```

### Fill in boudaries
We can fill in boudaies using argument `data_fill` in `geom_boundary()`. This argument takes a data frame that has `GEOID` as the first column and fill-in values as the second or other columns. You can use argument `mapping = aes(fill = ..xxx..)` to specify the fill column. Remember to add two dots `..` before and after the column name. If the data frame is extracted using census packages such as `tidycensus` and `totalcensus`, it already has the `GEOID` column.

```{r fig.width=12}
library(tidycensus)
census_api_key("your own api key")
# get the median home value in Providence county, RI by tract
home_value <- get_acs("tract", "B25077_001", state = "RI", county = "Providence") 
head(home_value, 3)
#    GEOID       NAME                                               variable   estimate   moe
#    <chr>       <chr>                                              <chr>         <dbl> <dbl>
#  1 44007000101 Census Tract 1.01, Providence County, Rhode Island B25077_001   155000  9765
#  2 44007000102 Census Tract 1.02, Providence County, Rhode Island B25077_001   154700 11819
#  3 44007000200 Census Tract 2, Providence County, Rhode Island    B25077_001   134600 31087

ggmap(ri) +
    geom_boundary("tract", data_fill = home_value, 
                  mapping = aes(fill = ..estimate..),
                  color = "blue", size = 0.1, alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_boundary("state", fill = NA, color = "red") +
    scale_fill_gradient(na.value = NA, low = "cyan", high = "orange") +
    labs(fill = "home_value")
```

### Combine with point plot
Let's look at the black community near South Bend, Indiana. We present the population at each census block as a point, sized with total population and colored with percentage of black population. On top of that, we draw the boundaries of census tract.

```{r fig.width=12}
library(totalcensus)
sb_black <- read_decennial(
    year = 2010,
    states = "IN",
    table_contents = "black_popul = P0030003",
    areas = "St. Joseph County, IN",
    summary_level = "block"
) %>% 
    .[population != 0] %>%
    # percentage of black population in each block
    .[, black_pct := round(100 * black_popul / population, 2)] %>%
    .[order(black_pct)]

sb <- get_map("south bend, IN", zoom = 13, color = "bw")
p <- ggmap(sb) +
    geom_point(data = sb_black, alpha = 0.8,
               aes(lon, lat, size = population, color = black_pct)) +
    geom_boundary("tract", fill = NA, color = "orange", size = 0.5) +
    scale_size_area(max_size = 15, breaks = c(10, 100, 200, 500, 4000)) +
    scale_color_continuous(low = "green", high = "red") 
p
```

![](figures/boundaries_with_point.png)


```{r}
# to zoom in
p +  coord_map(xlim = c(-86.26, -86.21), ylim = c(41.67, 41.7))
```
